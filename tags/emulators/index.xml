      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I wanted to briefly talk about what I&amp;rsquo;ve been up to lately.   I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing a spot of compiler hacking, working on improving type Providers and generally tinkering with concepts relating to macros etc.  I&amp;rsquo;ve also been tinkering with the Elixir and Rust programming languages which I like a lot.  I might write about those things at a later time depending on my train of thought which can be quite disjoint.  What was I talking about again?  :-)&lt;br /&gt;
