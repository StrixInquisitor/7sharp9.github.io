      <description>Ok so I have been offline for a while now, what with starting a new financial contract in London and not having any broadband access for a while.Â I have been working on something, honest!
Since the last post I have been reflecting on the pipeline design and it had a distinct object orientated feel to it that I wasnt happy with, so I have amended the structure of the code and come up with the following which simplifies in some areas and expands in others&amp;hellip;module Pipeline open System.</description>

      <description>Welcome to pipeline processing part 2. I feel I need to backtrack slightly from the previous post, having worked with pipelines for quite some time I have the advantage of knowing all of the details that may be alluded to in these articles without being effected by any omissions I may make, obviously you guys aren&amp;rsquo;t in that position, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to try and rectify that a bit now.</description>

      <description>Welcome to new series of articles on pipeline processing. First up, what&amp;rsquo;s a pipeline? Well according to Wikipedia:
 A pipeline is a set of data processing elements connected in series, so that the output of one element is the input of the next one. The elements of a pipeline are often executed in parallel or in time-sliced fashion; in that case, some amount of buffer storage is often inserted between elements.</description>
