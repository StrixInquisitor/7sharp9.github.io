      <description>In this post weare going to look as async again, but from the perspective of F#.
Xamarin Evolve 2013   I have been watching the Xamarin Evolve conference this week and it was good to see Miguel announce full support for F#. Those that follow me on twitter etc, will know that I have been doing F# for quite a while in MonoDevelop and Xamarin Studio. The new support currently entails some new project templates so that you can easily create epic new F# Apps without having to refer to my blog.</description>

      <description>I was going to title this post as &amp;lsquo;Now for something completely different&amp;rsquo; but felt that a little bit too Pythonesque, and when I thought about it a bit it isn&amp;rsquo;t really completely just slightly different, namely C# rather than my usual F# posts. Right, enough of the waffling, this post is a little tour into the relatively unknown area of async on iOS. Xamarin announced the alpha preview of async await on March 11th this year (2013).</description>

      <description>If I walk into my garage now and open up a toolbox, whats inside?
Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick selection:
 Ball-peen hammer Jointer plane 1&amp;frasl;2 inch mortise chisel Soldering iron Set square Low angle block plane Torx screw drivers Hack saw Monkey wrench Pipe cutter  Notice it doesn&amp;rsquo;t just contain:
 A sledge hammer.  Different tools have different purposes, you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t use a hammer and try to cut down a tree, or use a chisel to hammer a nail.</description>
