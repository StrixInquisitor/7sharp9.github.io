      <description>In this edition we are going to be doing a taste test, C# vs F#. Oh yeah, if you quickly glanced at the title you may have thought this was a recipe for black scones, as interesting and tasty as that may be, unfortunately its going to be finance related.
I recently presented a paper on the benefits of F#, part of this was a comparison of the famous Black-Scholes equation in both C# and F#.</description>
