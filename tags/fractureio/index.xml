      <description>Due to popular demand&amp;hellip; well, I had a couple of requests anyway :-) Heres a post inspired by my recent encounters profiling some of the code in Fracture-IO. I have recently been profiling the code in fracture to remove any so called low hanging fruits. During this time I also noticed an increase in memory allocation. I remembered I had recently been experimenting in a branch using pipelets as a buffer between the send and receive stages in the Http Server, so I set up a simple test to see if pipelets were contributing to the memory allocation issues I was seeing.</description>
