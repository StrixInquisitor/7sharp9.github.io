      <description>What is Myriad? Myriad is a pre-compilation tool that generates code from code. It is integrated into the project build cycle via an MSBuild extension. It is also possible to invoke the tool separately as a CLI tool but this essay will deal with describing the integration within an MSBuild project as this would be the most common pattern of usage.
Historical basis Before I dig into the detail its best to get some historical details as the Myriad project stems from previous meta-programming work that I have been doing over the last year, perhaps also further back through my history of using F# too.</description>
