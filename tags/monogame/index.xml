      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been on a bit of a break from my normal jovial self due to a shit storm of bad stuff happening that I wont go into here, but hopefully this years going to be awesome. Anyway, here&amp;rsquo;s the next exciting installment in my series on MonoGame. (Well I find it exciting anyway :-) )
If you remember back to the last post I mentioned the platonic solids, and we created and rendered the tetrahedron, lets recap on what the five solids are:</description>

      <description>This time we are going to get into a little bit of code and produce the simplest of all 3d solids, the tetrahedron. I know its not the most exciting of things but we have to start somewhere. The scope of 3D graphics in computers is so vast that its very easy to get lost in the vast piles of research papers.First lets do some basic setup, if you followed my last post then you will will have a project template to use, this makes this a little easier.</description>

      <description>What we are going to do in this post is take a whistle stop tour of getting MonoGame up and running along with a simple demo in F#. Over the last few days I have been building an F# project template for MonoDevelop, this post will also how to get that installed too. First of all I&amp;rsquo;m going to assume that you have the following installed:
 Mono 3.0 beta MonoDevelop MonoDevelop F# language binding  If you don&amp;rsquo;t have a look at my previous post that explains all that, if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to build the F# binding from source then you can use the Add-in Manager.</description>

      <description>So what have I been up to lately? Well, lots of different things. I have been taking it easy on the open source and blogging side of things as its been a hectic time of late in my personal life. This seems to be changing now so I&amp;rsquo;m starting to get all of the ideas spinning around in my head into physical reality, or virtual reality, or what ever you want to call it.</description>
