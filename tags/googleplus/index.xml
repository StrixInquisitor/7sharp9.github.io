      <description>Wow its been a long time since I wrote anything!
For those of you visiting here may be pleased to know that I&amp;rsquo;m finally getting round to writing again, but before a post with any real content I just wanted to mention a few things. I&amp;rsquo;m no longer on Twitter, Ive not just disabled my account Its actually deleted now, Ive waited the 30 days for it to expire so it should finally be gone now.</description>
